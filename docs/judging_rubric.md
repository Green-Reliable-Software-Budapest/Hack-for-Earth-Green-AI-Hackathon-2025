# Judging Rubric

Teams are evaluated on a **100‑point** scale. Judges will score each criterion independently and aggregate the results. Use this rubric to guide your planning and ensure that your solution addresses impact, technical quality, and open‑source best practices.

| Category | Points | What we’re looking for |
|---|---|---|
| **Impact & relevance** | **25** | Does the solution address a pressing climate challenge in a locally relevant and meaningful way? How well does it articulate the potential for positive environmental or societal impact? Does the project quantify expected benefits such as tonnes of CO₂ avoided, litres of water saved or people protected? Does it align with the hackathon theme of climate adaptation or mitigation? |
| **Resource efficiency & sustainability** | **10** | Does the team consider and minimise the environmental footprint of their own model? Have they measured and reported before/after resource usage (e.g. kWh, kg CO₂e, L H₂O) for the same task? Do they employ techniques like model compression, carbon‑aware scheduling or low‑power hardware? |
| **Technical rigour** | **20** | Is the solution technically sound and well engineered? Are the algorithms appropriate for the problem? Is the code clean, modular and documented? |
| **AI/ML approach** | **15** | How effectively does the project employ artificial intelligence or machine learning? Does it leverage state‑of‑the‑art techniques or propose a novel approach? |
| **Data use & documentation** | **10** | Does the project responsibly collect and use data? Are the datasets clearly described, with provenance and licensing information? Is the data pre‑processed appropriately? |
| **Feasibility & scalability** | **10** | Can the prototype be realistically deployed or scaled beyond the hackathon? Are potential limitations and next steps discussed? Does the team identify partnerships or stakeholders for real‑world adoption? |
| **User experience & communication** | **5** | Is the user interface intuitive, accessible and inclusive? Does the team clearly communicate what the solution does and why it matters? Are results visualised effectively? |
| **Open‑source quality & collaboration** | **5** | Is the code publicly available with a clear license? Are contributions welcomed? Is the project organised to enable collaboration beyond the event? |

### Challenge tracks (optional)

While you’re free to define your own problem, here are suggested tracks that reflect regional priorities in Central Europe and Hungary. Submissions may target one or several of these areas:

1. **Energy & Emissions** – Tools for optimising renewable energy integration, forecasting consumption, or reducing carbon intensity (e.g. smart scheduling of loads based on the Hungarian grid’s carbon mix).
2. **Agriculture & Food Security** – AI for crop yield prediction, precision irrigation, soil health monitoring or livestock management. Consider local crops like wheat, maize and sunflower.
3. **Water & Flood Management** – Early warning systems for floods or droughts using weather reanalysis (ERA5) and river gauge data; optimisation of water distribution in arid or flood‑prone regions.
4. **Air Quality & Health** – Low‑cost sensors and models to nowcast/predict air quality, particularly PM2.5 and NO₂, in Hungarian cities; solutions for public health advisories.
5. **Waste & Circular Economy** – AI‑powered tools to optimise recycling routes, detect illegal dumping via satellite imagery, or assess the carbon footprint of waste management.
6. **Biodiversity & Forestry** – Monitoring deforestation, wildfire risk and biodiversity loss using satellite data (Sentinel‑1/2, PlanetScope) and machine learning.
7. **Infrastructure & Mobility** – Routing and scheduling algorithms for low‑emission transport (e.g. electric vehicle fleets, shared mobility) with a focus on urban centres like Budapest.

Feel free to adapt these tracks or propose your own. The goal is to build something meaningful and impactful.
