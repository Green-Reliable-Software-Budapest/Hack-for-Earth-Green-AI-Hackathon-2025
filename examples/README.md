# Examples

This directory contains simple examples to help you get started with the AI for Earth hackathon starter kit. Feel free to explore, run, and extend these examples as inspiration for your own projects.

- `simple_example.py` – a minimal Python script that demonstrates how to load a dataset, run a basic calculation, and print results. It uses only built‑in libraries and is intended to show file structure and execution flow.

You can add more examples here or create subdirectories for specific topics (e.g., `notebooks/` for Jupyter notebooks, `geospatial/` for EO processing). Please keep examples lightweight and do not commit large data files; instead, link to datasets or download them at runtime.

To run an example, activate your virtual environment and execute:

```bash
python examples/simple_example.py
```

We encourage you to document any examples you contribute with comments and clear descriptions, so others can learn from your work.
