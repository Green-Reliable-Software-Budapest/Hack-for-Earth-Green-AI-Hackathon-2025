# Pitch Deck Template

Your pitch deck is a concise narrative of your project. Use up to 10 slides to convey the problem you solved, how your AI solution works, the results you achieved, and the real-world impact. Keep it visual, clear and focused on storytelling.

## 1. Title

- Project name and tagline.
- Team members.
- Logo or image that represents your project.

## 2. Problem & context

- Describe the climate challenge you addressed (e.g., drought monitoring, low-carbon logistics).
- Explain the local or sectoral context (Hungary/Central Europe if relevant).
- Quantify the size of the problem (people affected, emissions, costs).

## 3. Solution overview

- Summarise your AI-powered solution.
- Highlight what makes it unique or innovative.
- Include a high-level diagram if helpful.

## 4. Data & methodology

- Data sources and any preprocessing.
- Model architecture and algorithms used.
- Tools and libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn).

## 5. Results & validation

- Key performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, precision-recall, etc.).
- Visualisations or examples that demonstrate performance.
- Comparisons to baselines if available.

## 6. Resource efficiency

- Summarise your energy, carbon and water footprint measurements.
- Show before/after metrics (kWh, kg CO2e, L H2O) and highlight optimisation techniques.
- Discuss hardware used and any carbon-aware scheduling.

## 7. Impact & benefits

- Quantify the real-world impact: tonnes CO2 avoided, resources saved, people protected.
- Describe who benefits and how.
- Discuss potential for scale or replication.

## 8. Limitations & risks

- Outline known limitations or uncertainties in your approach.
- Discuss ethical, fairness or privacy considerations.

## 9. Next steps

- Roadmap for further development (e.g., deploy in production, gather more data, improve the model).
- Partnerships or support needed.

## 10. Call to action

- End with a clear call to action: invite collaborators, share your repo, or propose a pilot project.
