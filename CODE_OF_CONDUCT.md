# Code of Conduct

This project and community follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) Code of Conduct. We expect all contributors and participants to help create a welcoming and harassment‑free environment for everyone.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and inclusive environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project and our hackathon a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Providing constructive feedback and graceful acceptance of criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing courtesy and respect in all interactions

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other’s private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions, as well as any private communication related to the project. It also applies during the hackathon and any associated events such as meetups or webinars.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported confidentially by sending an email to **info@dataimmigrant.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers who receive a report of a Code of Conduct violation will investigate the situation and determine an appropriate response. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
