# Security Policy

Thank you for helping to keep this project secure. We take security issues seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

This repository provides reference code, examples and documentation for the **Green Reliable AI for Earth Hackathon**. We aim to keep the contents up to date prior to the event; however, there is no longâ€‘term maintenance guarantee. Always check the commit history and release notes for current status.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue or pull request**. Instead, please follow these steps:

1. **Email us privately** at **security@greenreliable.hu** with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. If you have a working proof of concept, please include it.
2. Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and fix the issue before any public disclosure.
3. We will acknowledge receipt of your report and keep you informed of our progress. Once the issue is resolved, we will work with you to coordinate disclosure.

We appreciate researchers and users who take the time to disclose issues responsibly and will credit your contribution in the changelog unless you request otherwise.
